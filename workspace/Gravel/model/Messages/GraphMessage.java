 * This Class represents alls possible Updates and changes,

 * An Update Message is read Only so only the constructor can set internal values.
 * <br>Updates may contain

 * <br>- Nodes
 * <br>- Edges
 * <br>- Subgraphs
 * <br> - Selections
 * <br> - Changes in allowance of Loops, Multiple Edges
 * <br> - Change whether the Graph is directed or not
 * <br> - A Graph translation or replacement
 * <br><br>- Begin and End of a Block of Changes (e.g. to group them somewhere in the stats)
 * <br> Therefore Type and Affected must be 0, ID must be -1
 * They may occur together in one message. If only one Item was changed, it's ID is given
